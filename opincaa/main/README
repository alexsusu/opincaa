Steps to build and install OPINCAA:

1) make                             Build the OPINCAA library
2) [optional] sudo make install     Install the OPINCAA library in your system in /usr/local/lib   
3) [optional] make test             Compile an executable against the installed OPINCAA library and run some tests

NOTE: if you choose not to install the library, you will need to manually specify the location of the library when
compiling or running executables linked against it. These are the necessary steps to run the executable "foo":

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=*/path/to/opincaa/library*
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./foo
